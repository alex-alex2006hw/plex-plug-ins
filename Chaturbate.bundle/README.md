Chaturbate
===========

This plugin creates a new video channel within [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv/) (PMS) to view content from [chaturbate.com](https://chaturbate.com/). It is currently under development and as such, should be considered alpha software and potentially unstable.  For now this is a very simple version of what it could be.

> **Note:** The author of this plugin has no affiliation with [chaturbate.com](https://chaturbate.com/) site nor the owners of the content that they host.
